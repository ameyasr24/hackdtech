# Be Well. Mental Health for Students, by Students

A community for Duke Students to easily seek out mental health resources and lean on their peers for support.

Created By: Alena Zhang, Gargi Mahadeshwar, Ameya Rao, Elayna Lei, and Christina Yoh

### Inspiration

While Duke does have a plethora of resources for mental health, we find that oftentimes it is hard to navigate them. It may be difficult to find information through Duke websites or simply just intimidating and overwhelming to reach out to these resources. We wanted to create a safe space for Duke students to feel comfortable utilizing the available mental health resources and to encourage discourse regarding students’ personal experiences with mental health, Duke resources, and more. 

### What it does

Our website has two primary features: a forum and a chatbot. Our forum operates similarly to a Reddit feed/a blog; students can post testimonials anonymously about experiences they’ve had using Duke mental health resources and provide advice. This way, students can read about how their peers were able to use these resources, or even learn which resources didn’t help them in certain situations. This is a resource created for students, by students, and we hope that this forum can be a safe space where students can talk about mental health and help each other face their challenges through common experiences. Our second primary feature is a chatbot, which efficiently redirects students to Duke mental health or external resources. Our chatbot prompts the user with “how are you feeling”, in which students can respond. Based on keywords in the student’s responses, we lead students to specific Duke resources or wellness practices. The chatbot clearly outlines the steps students have to take in order to make the experience less daunting. For example, if a student’s responses prompt the chatbot to suggest Blue Devils Care, the chatbot will provide explicit steps for setting up their account and making an appointment.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
